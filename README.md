# Font-pairings

## Introduction 
Every week for seven weeks I'll be creating responsive and expressive layouts with pre-assigned font pairings and text snippets. The gh-pages for this repo will be a one-page compilation of all these projects. 

Week one fonts: 
[lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?category=Sans+Serif)
[unna](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unna?category=Serif,Sans+Serif&query=unna)
